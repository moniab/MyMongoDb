# MyMongoDb
In this repository I created a database and collection on MongoDB through Python.

After creating an account on MongoDB Atlas, I could menage it using Python. In particular I can:
- create databases;
- create collections;
- insert elements in the collections;
- update elements of the collections;
- query the database;

Then, I created a datalake MongoDB Atlas and I did some experiments on it trying some query.
