# MyMongoDb
In this repository I used MongoDB Atlas and Python to create a database, a collection and a datalake.

In the file "Creazione_database.ipynb" I created a database and collection on MongoDB through Python.
After creating an account on MongoDB Atlas, I could menage it using Python. In particular I can:
- create databases;
- create collections;
- insert elements in the collections;
- update elements of the collections;
- query the database;

Then, I created a datalake on MongoDB Atlas and I did some experiments on it trying some query (reachable in the file "Query_datalake.ipynb")


### Why Use MongoDB?
(From the official documentation of MongoDB) 
MongoDB is built on a scale-out architecture that has become popular with developers of all kinds for developing scalable applications with evolving data schemas.
As a document database, MongoDB makes it easy for developers to store structured or unstructured data. It uses a JSON-like format to store documents. This format directly maps to native objects in most modern programming languages, making it a natural choice for developers, as they donâ€™t need to think about normalizing data. MongoDB can also handle high volume and can scale both vertically or horizontally to accommodate large data loads.
